PRISM HUD

Thanks for downloading my HUD!

-------------------------------------------------------------
To Install
-------------------------------------------------------------
Either use Mr Modez's Mod Manager to install this zip

Or

Unzip and move the _prism_hud folder into steam/steamapps/common/team fortress 2/tf/custom/

If you go into the resource folder (for example), the folder path should look like tf/custom/_prism_hud/resource/
tf/custom/mycustomstuff/_prism_hud/resource/ is wrong
tf/custom/resource/ is wrong

-------------------------------------------------------------
To Customize
-------------------------------------------------------------
A program like 4plug (packed with the hud) will handle file overrides
4plug		- http://steamcommunity.com/groups/4stuff

After running tf2 with prism hud installed once, a file "prismhud.txt" will be created in your cfg folder. It controls things that're easier managed with scripts. 
Change the variable values to your liking in it.

If you want to manually override files, you could go into resource/ui_overrides/ and copy whichever res file you want and replace the corresponding file in resource/ui/
DO NOT CUT OR MOVE THE FILES - DO NOT CUT OR MOVE THE FILES - DO NOT CUT OR MOVE THE FILES
Only copy and with that replace, cutting or moving the files and replacing will mean that you'd have to redownload the hud again after a few changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------
To Edit
-------------------------------------------------------------
This hud makes heavy usage of the #base "file" feature, which effectively allows for separated res files and/or creation of "manifest" files for .res's.
Any #base file here that ends with _noto should be exactly what notohud uses and a lot of edits should go into those, though no guarantees that those edits won't be overridde

If you're used to editing huds, there's nothing hugely different once you get past that.
