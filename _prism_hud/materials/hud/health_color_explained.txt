yeah this is the default health_color.

To get the color right, an additive material is thrown on top of the healthcross that makes it 255 255 255
Once that happens, another texture is thrown on to change the color of it slighty, in this case 0 0 0 10 so that the healthcross becomes 245 245 245
The additive material is very finely tuned to specifically the default healthcross.

By making use of my own textures and not replacing any, it can pass through sv_pure 1 and 2
You can find these textures in /materials/vgui/replay/thumbnails/hp/


The reason health_color.vtf is here is so that if someone has a custom healthcross mod, like another one to make it a solid color or one to turn it into a heart or something like that, the additive texture won't completely butcher everything on sv_pure 0 servers
